## Overview

This document outlines ongoing work on the Jupyter notebooks in the Heart Disease Prediction project. **IMPORTANT: The notebook implementation is still under development and requires further testing and improvement.**

## Current Notebooks

The project currently contains the following notebooks:

1. **heart_disease_prediction_tutorial.ipynb**
   - Original tutorial notebook (contains issues)
   - Missing critical dependencies
   - Has structural problems

2. **heart_disease_prediction_tutorial_updated.ipynb**
   - Updated version attempting to fix issues in the original
   - Added time module import (missing in original)
   - Still has structural and execution issues
   - Format problems identified during testing
   - Fails when run with certain data configurations

3. **test_notebook.ipynb**
   - Minimal test notebook for dependency verification
   - Created for debugging purposes
   - Used to isolate issues with core dependencies
   - Contains synthetic data generation to bypass data loading issues

## Known Issues

Multiple serious issues have been identified and need to be addressed:

1. **Structural Problems**
   - Notebook format inconsistencies causing validation errors
   - Missing required fields in cell metadata
   - Issues with cell execution counts

2. **Dependency Problems**
   - Missing imports (time module was added but other dependencies may be missing)
   - Tabulate dependency missing from requirements
   - Potential hidden dependencies not documented

3. **Data Loading Issues**
   - Hardcoded paths that don't work in all environments
   - Missing error handling for absent data files
   - Incompatible data formats between different versions

4. **Execution Stability**
   - Notebooks fail during batch processing examples
   - Environment-specific configuration causes failures
   - Accessibility issues with visualizations

## Current Fixes

We're in the process of addressing these issues:

1. Added missing `time` module import to updated tutorial notebook
2. Added `tabulate` dependency to requirements files
3. Created test notebook to isolate and verify dependency issues
4. Identified format problems requiring additional fixes

## TODO

Significant work remains to be done:

1. **Complete Notebook Restructuring**
   - Rewrite notebooks with consistent structure
   - Fix all metadata and format issues
   - Ensure compatibility with nbconvert

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Comprehensive audit of all required dependencies
   - Explicit version pinning in requirements
   - Automated dependency verification

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add robust error handling throughout
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
   - Clear error messages and debugging instructions

4. **Testing Protocol**
   - Develop systematic testing procedure
   - Create validation notebook for CI/CD
   - Automated execution testing in clean environments

## Using the Notebooks (With Caution)

If you need to use the notebooks in their current state:

1. Install all dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn requests tabulate
   ```

2. Verify basic functionality with the test notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute notebooks/test_notebook.ipynb
   ```

3. Be aware that the main tutorial notebooks may fail in various scenarios

## Reporting Issues

When encountering notebook problems:
1. Document the exact error message
2. Note which cell failed
3. List your environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)
4. Report all issues to the development team

**Note: These notebooks should be considered experimental until further notice.**
