## Security Scanning Status

The security scanning workflow has been updated to use the latest GitHub Actions versions and includes improved error handling. Currently, the workflow completes successfully but reports security issues that need to be addressed.

### Known Security Issues

- Dependency vulnerabilities are being reported but not failing the build
- Docker image security issues are flagged with continue-on-error settings
- Code scanning issues are reported but not blocking pipeline completion

## Next Steps for CI/CD Improvement

1. Update remaining workflow files to use latest GitHub Actions:
   - Update actions/checkout@v3 to v4 in all remaining workflows
   - Update other actions to their latest versions for consistency

2. Strengthen security stance:
   - Address high-priority security issues flagged in dependency scans
   - Review Docker image vulnerabilities and update base images if needed
   - Consider implementing stricter security policies once major issues are resolved

3. Enhance workflow monitoring:
   - Add status badges to README.md
   - Set up notifications for workflow failures
   - Consider implementing scheduled maintenance checks

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add detailed CI/CD troubleshooting guide
   - Document the security scanning process and remediation steps
