# Heart Disease Prediction System: Project Status

*Date: March 31, 2025*

## Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction system is a production-ready machine learning application for cardiovascular risk assessment. It employs multiple neural network models (scikit-learn MLP and Keras/TensorFlow) combined with an ensemble approach to achieve high prediction accuracy. The system is packaged with a comprehensive API, web interface, testing infrastructure, and deployment options.

## Completed Features

### Core Machine Learning

- ✅ Data preprocessing pipeline with automated cleaning and normalization
- ✅ Feature engineering for medical parameters
- ✅ Strategic train/validation/test splitting with stratification
- ✅ scikit-learn MLP implementation with optimized configuration
- ✅ Keras/TensorFlow deep learning model implementation
- ✅ Ensemble methodology combining predictions from both models

### API and User Interface

- ✅ FastAPI REST API for real-time predictions with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- ✅ Multiple endpoint options (single prediction, batch prediction)
- ✅ Web-based user interface for interactive demonstration
- ✅ Comprehensive API usage examples in multiple languages

### Testing and Quality

- ✅ Extensive unit testing for all components
- ✅ Integration testing for the API
- ✅ Error handling test suite
- ✅ Performance/load testing infrastructure
- ✅ Docker containerization with compose setup

### Documentation

- ✅ API usage documentation with curl examples
- ✅ Comprehensive project documentation
- ✅ Data dictionary for medical parameters
- ✅ Model architecture details
- ✅ Usage guides and examples

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

Based on the completed features and the project roadmap, the following items are prioritized for future development:

### 1. Optimization

- [ ] Address TensorFlow NumPy array conversion warning
- [ ] Optimize batch prediction performance for large batches
- [ ] Implement model caching for improved throughput

### 2. Documentation

- [ ] Create interactive tutorial notebook
- [ ] Add system architecture diagram
- [ ] Create downloadable report format

### 3. Security & Deployment

- [ ] Add authentication to API
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Create environment-specific configuration for dev/staging/prod

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

1. **Warnings and Deprecations**
   - Pydantic deprecation warnings for Field examples (fixed in latest commit)
   - TensorFlow NumPy array conversion warning still present

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Batch processing could be optimized for larger batches
   - No caching mechanism for repeated predictions

3. **Security Considerations**
   - No authentication implemented yet
   - No encryption for data in transit (when not using HTTPS)
