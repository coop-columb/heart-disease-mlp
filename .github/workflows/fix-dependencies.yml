          ## Dependency Update

          This PR updates the requirements.txt file to use more flexible versioning, which will:

          - Fix CI/CD pipeline failures due to exact version constraints
          - Make the project compatible with different systems and architectures
          - Still maintain minimum version requirements for security and functionality

          The specific versions are replaced with ">=" version specifiers to ensure backward compatibility while allowing newer versions to be used.
